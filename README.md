# Alien::Zcash

Easily install Zcash via CPAN and specify it as a dependency in Perl applications

# What does this do?

This allows you to tell your favorite CPAN installer to install Zcash, via your
local CPAN mirror. This allows Perl applications to specify that they depend on
an external dependency, Zash, in a standard way, the Alien::* namespace. Most
likely you will not use this module directly, you just want to do

    cpan Alien::Zcash

to install with the normal CPAN.pm client or:

    cpanm Alien::Zcash

to use the newer, more featureful cpanminus client.
